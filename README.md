## Introduction

Deep learning has numerous applications, and understanding different model architectures is crucial for applying these techniques effectively. This repository provides implementations of several popular deep learning models, including AlexNet, InceptionNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and VGGNet. Each implementation is designed to be clear and educational.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saketjha34/Deep-Learning-Model-Architectures.git
cd Deep-Learning-Model-Architectures
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each model has its own directory containing the implementation and a sample script. To run a sample script, navigate to the model's directory and execute the script:

```bash
cd AlexNet
python example.py
```

You can modify the scripts and model parameters as needed for your specific use case.

## Model Architectures

This repository includes the following model architectures:

- [AlexNet](AlexNet/): Implementation of AlexNet, a pioneering deep convolutional neural network.
- [InceptionNet](InceptionNet/): Implementation of the Inception architecture, also known as GoogLeNet.
- [MobileNet](MobileNet/): Implementation of MobileNet, a lightweight deep learning model for mobile and embedded vision applications.
- [ResNet](ResNet/): Implementation of ResNet, known for its use of residual connections to ease the training of deep networks.
- [VGGNet](VGGNet/): Implementation of VGGNet, a deep convolutional network known for its simplicity and depth.
